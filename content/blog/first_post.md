# What's the Point of Writing a Blog in 2025?

## Intro

As the title suggests, I'm starting a blog in 2025 and I'm not even 100% sure why. I don't think I'm an extremely interesting person. My most interesting hobbies are Linux tinkering and playing golf, not exactly riveting things to write about. Age and experience aren't on my side either; I'm only 25 going on 26 and have been in my career for about 4 years. So what am I even doing?

## The Good Ol' Days

Maybe I'm stricken with anemoia, nostalgia for a time period I've never experienced. Or I guess the better way to phrase it would be "too young to have fully experienced. Born in 1999, I never had the chance to experience the true wild west early days of the Internet. Growing up, I remember being enamored with game forums like gamefaqs, IGN, and random blogs I would stumble upon when looking for help on how to find a certain item im TESIV: Oblivion or how to beat the final level of The Simpsons: Hit & Run (if you know you know). As I've gotten older, relatively speaking, I've really gained an appreciation for the late 90s/early 2000s tech I was able to experience growing up. Although I wasn't really old enough to appreciate it at the time, I miss the days of seeing people use the Internet for fun. YouTube videos were primarily dumb skits like Fred, or "Charlie Bit Me", or any of the other stupid early videos. Facebook was truly a platform for connecting with your friends and family, and spamming them with requests to join you in FarmVille. People were uploading content to the Internet not to make a quick buck based off the current fad. Sure, there were probably plenty of people who still did that, but to a dumb kid like me, the Internet was full of fun things to find and explore. Now, you can't visit a single page without being inundated with AI generated slop, "hot takes", or constant hyper-political discourse. Again, I'm not trying to act like this stuff didn't exist back then, but it still seems a lot better than compared to today.

## Software Freedom

Part of my drive to write my own blog is based in my love of Linux and its surrounding hacker culture. Hacker not in the "I've encrypted all your files, so give me your money" hacking, but hacking in the "person with computer skills who solves problems through non-standard means" way ([Wikipedia Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker)). While I am by no means a skilled programmer, I have just enough know-how and willingness to break things that I will jump into new technology/software. I also have seen how the FOSS movement within the computing world has made so many different technologies available to the public. If you aren't familiar, FOSS stands for "Free and Open Source Software", meaning you as the user of said software have the freedom to both inspect the actual code as well as to modify it to suit your needs. While FOSS doesn't necessarily mean free as in "zero cost", in many cases the software typically is provided for absolutely free. While there are plenty of FOSS social networking tools out there collectively known as the "Fediverse", I don't really care to have any sort of social media presence. A blog is more so just a public journal for me. I don't really want to shove it down someones throat and hope I see a cool upvote/like/favorite/whatever. I truly just want to use this as a way to get my thoughts out in a way that could spark some ideas. Whether those are my own ideas being sparked or someone else's doesn't matter.

## What I'm Going to Write About

This blog will serve as a place to save my ramblings first and foremost. I'm odd in that my brain is either off or on, there's not really an in-between. So if I have a lot of thoughts, I really need a way to get them out. I'd like to write about random Linux things, software/tech in general, video games, and honestly whatever else strikes my fancy. There's no real category or theme to the blog, just my ramblings!

## Conlcusion

If you made it this far, congratulations. If you skipped ahead, well played! Hopefully this isn't like many of my other projects where I start something and then drop it after a week or two. While posts may be infrequent, I hope I can at least put something out there every now and then.
